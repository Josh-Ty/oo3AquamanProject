Title: Entrepreneur Simulator

Theme: SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth

- Entrepreneur Simulator is a simple Java application akin to the famous Cookie Clicker game series, it teaches users to reinvest their money for continued and sustainable economic growth. It allows users to "work" (click) for money and reinvest that money into different investments that can grow overtime (investment profits/revenue). It features two ways to earn money, one for the shop and passive income (investment), and the other for active income ("work" - clicking). The goal of the game is to raise a certain amount of cash as fast as possible. The time it takes to get to that amount will be recorded and be shown in the end screen before taking them back to the main menu. There will also be an alternative game mode to gain as much cash as possible within a certain time limit. The score will similarly be shown in the end screen but using a different metric and send them back to the main menu.

Rules:
- Earn money by starting tasks
- Use earned money to invest and expand to other businesses and earn more money faster
  - Hire managers along the way to automate certain tasks
- Reach a certain amount of money in the shortest time possible
- Reach the most money in a certain amount of time

Additional Features: 
+ The Investment Shop
+ Clicking
+ 2 Different Gamemodes
+ More to come

    + What makes our game stand out compared to other games is that we incorporate 2 subgenres of the game into one, which will utilize           split canvas display to make it happen, and that it is a time-trial leaderboard that records how fast a player can reach a set              monetary goal, which other games usually don't have, as they are designed to be endless.
+ Cookie Clickers
    + The game won't just be a cookie clicker that requires endless monotonous clicking, but more akin to starting a timer for a task to be       able to actually generate revenue.
